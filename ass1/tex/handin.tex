The code is implemented in the attached zip file under the \texttt{cuda} directory as \texttt{ass1.cu} and with a makefile as described.
It has some global variables like number of threads and whether to time memory transfers set in define clauses in the file.

\subsection{timings}

\begin{table}[ht]
\caption{timings - avg of 3 runs all on gpu01 at diku server}

\begin{tabular}{c|c|c}
 800.000 calcs & GPU & CPU \\
\hline with MEM & 3.11 ms & 3.19 ms\\
\hline without MEM & 0.165 ms & 3.26 ms
\end{tabular}
\end{table}
All calculations are within a fault tolerance (EPSILON) of 0.0005.
It seems that with the current calculations, around 14200 calculations make it break even. 
But if you do count the memory transfers in, it barely break even at 800.000 calculations.
There is a define statement in the code to switch timing of memory transfers.
